# THICH NHAT HANH´S GATHAS

Dwelling in the present moment, We can see so many beauties and wonders right before our eyes–a child’s smile, the sun rising, the autumn leaves. We can be happy just by being aware of what is in front of us. Practicing with gathas can help us return to ourselves and to what is going on in the present moment. It is helpful to memorize these gathas, a few at first, and more as You go on with the practice. As You silently recite the first line, breathe in; and as You  silently recite the second line, breathe out. When the gathas are finished, continue your activity, and You will find that your mindfulness has increased. When We drive, road signs help us find our way. We “see” the last sign until the next one appears. Practicing with gathas is the same. When we practice well, the gathas are with us continuously, and we live our whole day in awareness.

## Before Eating

The Buddha advises us to be mindful while we eat, to be in touch with the Sangha and the food. Brothers and sisters, when you hear the bell, meditate  on the Five Contemplations: This food is the gift of the whole universe, the earth, the sky, and much hard work. May we be worthy to receive it. May we transform unskillful states of mind, especially the habit of eating without moderation. May we take only foods that nourish us and prevent illness. We accept this food to realize the path of understanding and love.
